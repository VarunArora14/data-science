Real world data misses data for many reasons and many machine learning models just cannotrun without missing data therefore we have to 
do changes to the data to make it usable for the model.
When reading values, they are displayed as NaN values and new values like pd.NaT meaning it should be a timestamp but it is not.

We have to make choices for missing data - 
1. Drop the rows with missing data
2. Fill the missing data with a value
3. Keep it as it is

If you keep the missing data, the data set remains the same but some methods wont run NaN values
Another way is to put a reasonable guess for the missing data, like the mean of the column or the median of the column

Another way is to drop data for missing data. Cons are that you lose data and you might lose important data.
It may limit trained data and it may limit the accuracy of the model.

It is better to check how big the data being dropped is, it's impact and if it is worth it to drop it.
Dropping a column is a good choice if most rows or every row has it missing

Filling the missing data - Potentially help for data points that are missing but are important
Cons - Hardest to do and may lead to false conclusions
